To help your model predict expenses, revenue, income_tax, ebit, grossProfit, profit_before_tax, we need to identify how the data in your backend corresponds to these features. Below is a detailed mapping of similar features between the required prediction columns and your available backend tables.

Feature Mapping:
Target Feature (Prediction Column)	Similar Backend Feature (Tables)	Comments
expenses	Table 2 (Income): amount
Table 4 (Expense): amount	Use amount from expenses in Table 4. Ensure to aggregate by date or category if needed.
revenue	Table 3 (Profit): revenue	Direct match; revenue already exists in Profit table.
income_tax	Not explicitly available	You may need to calculate or derive this based on net_profit and country-specific tax rules.
ebit (Earnings Before Interest & Taxes)	Table 3 (Profit): net_profit
Table 2 (Income): amount	EBIT ≈ net_profit + income_tax (approx.). If interest data is unavailable, focus on profit and expenses.
grossProfit	Table 3 (Profit): profit_margin or net_profit
Table 2 (Income): amount	If profit_margin represents the ratio of profit to revenue, you can derive gross profit as: gross_profit = revenue - expenses.
profit_before_tax	Table 3 (Profit): net_profit	Use net_profit as a proxy for profit before tax if income_tax isn't directly available.
How to Utilize the Backend Data for Model Prediction:
Expenses:

Extract amount from Table 4 (Expense).
Aggregate by date or category if needed, to match the format required by your model.
Revenue:

Directly use the revenue field from Table 3 (Profit).
Income Tax:

You may need to estimate or derive this using net_profit and a tax rate.
Formula:
makefile
Copy code
income_tax = net_profit * (estimated_tax_rate)
You can also explore if your business applies any fixed tax rates based on profit ranges.
EBIT (Earnings Before Interest & Taxes):

If interest expenses aren't available, approximate EBIT using:
makefile
Copy code
EBIT = net_profit + income_tax 
Gross Profit:

If you only have profit margins or net profit, compute it:
makefile
Copy code
gross_profit = revenue - expenses 
Profit Before Tax:

Use net_profit from Table 3 as a proxy for profit before tax.
Additional Suggestions:
Data Aggregation: Ensure data is aggregated appropriately by date to align with the predictions.
Missing Features: If income_tax or interest isn't directly available, you’ll have to derive them. Alternatively, you can omit them from the model if not critical.
Model Training: Make sure your training data matches the structure of these backend tables, especially in terms of date alignment and aggregations.
Conclusion:
This mapping should allow you to pull data from your backend tables to feed your model. You have most of the key features available, though income tax may need some derivation. You can now build appropriate queries to aggregate the data by date and category, aligning it with what your model needs.
